United Kingdom,Sky News,Big,Shortlist,,Carmen Aguilar Garcia,"After seven years working as a TV reporter and a digital journalist in several media in Spain and Chile, I had the opportunity to work on a data project. Neither I nor the rest of the team had previous experience working with data, so we took a few online courses before starting. The process wasn't easy nor efficient due to our lack of knowledge but, after finalising it, I realised this was the kind of journalism I wanted to specialise in. I kept taking online courses but the more I dug into this discipline the more I discovered I could and should learn about it. I, therefore, decided to invest a full year learning about data and its application to journalism to have a strong preparation before facing this new path in my career. I then moved to the UK to study the MA Data Journalism at Birmingham City University, led by Paul Bradshaw, who has become my referent since then. As soon as I graduated, I had the opportunity to join Sky News as the first data journalist. I was the first but did not want to be the only one for longer. My main goal was to show how data journalism adds value to traditional reporting and to demonstrate that this is a discipline to put the focus on and invest in. I was only a reporter, so the way of showing this was making an impact with my work. My new skills were useful to find new stories hidden in data that other media hadn't reported about. I have also contributed to other colleagues' stories by looking for new stories or angles and by using data to add context and to explain the wider problem. Data has also been the starting point of several investigations published on all our platforms, and it has been used to allow the user to personalise the information, offering and analysing data as local as possible. As a solo data journalist, I have covered the whole process, from checking the quality of the data to building visualisations and creating visual projects. But I have not been alone. I have made collaboration with other departments a fundamental part of my strategy. On one hand, I have contributed to other journalists' work - helping them with statistical analysis, creating data structures to easily query data and share findings, offering new stories and helping with visual storytelling. I have also trained journalists and designers to use data visualisation tools and data software. On the other hand, joining forces with professionals with specific skills (such developers, correspondents and designers) enriched and improved the stories I have worked in and made possible more complex projects. This idea of collaboration also contributed to showing what data journalism is and how it can add value to their work across the newsroom, planting a small seed in every department. When the pandemic started, my workload increased exponentially but all this previous work laid the foundation to better face the new challenge. Since COVID started, I have published stories and visualisations more frequently and have worked with designers, TV reporters, digital journalists and developers to create useful content for our audience. But , I also went a step further and co-developed an automation project from which all the newsroom benefited from. Almost two years since I joined, I am not the only data journalist in Sky News anymore. Not only am I part of a team, but I have been recognized in international conferences and invited to share my expertise with other journalists who, like me, might be facing a solo","In all the projects I am presenting I have been in charge of the data analysis and the data visualisations, as well as co-structuring the stories to better present them for our audience. I have adapted my skills and my knowledge to the process and necessities of each story, using several data tools, such as R, Python, Excel, Open Refine, QGIS and Google Sheets to gather, clean and analyse data, and building visualisations with Flourish and Datawrapper to tell visual stories. I have worked on daily stories as well as medium- and long-term projects and investigations, which means that I have had to manage my time efficiently to meet all necessities. The pressure on daily and weekly stories - such as COVID analyses about infections and excess deaths within the UK and Europe or analyses to reveal the inequality in the rollout of the vaccine across the world and the importance of India in the vaccine supply - has been considerably high. I have undertaken high-level analyses, co-produced the stories and built visualisations in a short period of time - sometimes within a day. In addition to that time pressure, working for an international media means meeting high expectations, reaching a diverse audience and competing with bigger data teams. While working on longer projects and investigations, I have developed strong collaboration skills and created a robust working relationship with many departments across Sky News. The story about the people displaced due to climate events involved collaborating with designers and reporters, as well as external organisations (the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre), and I joined forces with the recently created forensic team to reveal deforestation in the highest protected areas of the Brazilian Amazon. One of the biggest challenges during the first two years was facing the pandemic. Covering this story was a titanic work for a single person, and, again, collaboration was key to face this up. Working with a developer, we automated part of the data process (gathering, cleaning, standardising and visualising data) and we've created stories - such as the travel tracker - which updated automatically to offer the latest information to our users without any daily human intervention This is one of the projects which has had a great impact internally. It has contributed to saving dozens of hours, especially to the data team, increasing the number of stories and visualisations published and offering up-to-date information at any time to our users. This system has also impacted on creating consistency among the departments, increasing the efficiency in the data and design departments and improving the content of many of our digital stories. Moreover, it has been recognised externally, as we were invited to talk about it at the Journalism AI Conference and it was shortlisted in the SIGMA Awards. Several experts have also praised many of the data stories, such as the one about the lack of diversity among the UK councilors, the investigation about the deforestation in the Amazon and the shortage of general practitioners (GPs) in England. Likewise, the scroll-down technique to present the data in many of the stories better present the information and increase the engagement, and it has also been highlighted by people in and out of the industry. Pageviews are also a good metric to assess the impact. Many of the data stories have been in the top ten of the most viewed on our digital site. In fact, the story about the shortage of GPs in England has been one of the most-read stories of 2021, even though it was published at the end of the year.",English,https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-deaths-above-average-in-almost-every-area-of-great-britain-12198585,https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-three-quarters-of-european-countries-see-coronavirus-cases-rise-12241884,https://news.sky.com/story/the-vaccine-divide-wealthy-nations-have-23-jabs-for-every-one-in-a-poorer-country-12215449,https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-how-does-indias-pause-on-vaccine-export-hurt-other-nations-12290300,https://news.sky.com/story/climate-change-the-people-forced-from-their-homes-by-floods-wildfires-storms-and-sea-level-rise-12355533,https://news.sky.com/story/amazon-alert-deforestation-warnings-at-record-levels-in-protected-parts-of-brazil-12416814,https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-summer-tracker-in-depth-guide-to-how-different-countries-rates-compare-12324242,https://news.sky.com/story/the-number-of-doctors-is-falling-and-appointments-are-going-up-but-thats-only-part-of-the-problem-12431982,,,,,,,,,
Brazil,"Fiquem Sabendo, OCCRP, freelance",Small,Shortlist,,Using data to monitor FOIA in brazil,"Stories I've written in the past 10 years helped to save millions in public funds and investigate illegal practices from individuals, companies and governments. I used to do investigative journalism by talking to lots of people and reading hundreds of documents. I still do it, but now I have been learning how to code to collaborate with cross-border and data-driven projects. In 2021 I have been sharing my time between reporting using data and developing projects that help other journalists and researchers get the data they need. I created scrapers that improve how all Brazilian journalists can find public data. One of the scrapers finds all FOIA (Freedom of Information) requests answered by the federal government in Brazil since the law was enacted, in 2012, based on a keyword and time range that interests the user, and then put them all into a CSV file. There is another scraper that helps people analyze what kind of information request is being denied by the government due to privacy or secrecy laws. It scrapes and parses a huge dataset looking for those cases, finds PDFs and transforms the information into a simple CSV file. Both scrapers can be found here. In the first semester, as a Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism fellow, I have created a guide on how to get the maximum potential from FOIA requests. This project evolved and now it is being used to teach thousands of journalists in Brazil through a partnership between the organization I co-founded, Fiquem Sabendo, and of the most relevant investigative journalistic associations in Latin America, Abraji. At Fiquem Sabendo, me and my team have opened multiple datasets that were being held from Brazilian citizens. We ended the secrecy of companies and people who deforest the Amazon and get fines for that. We've revealed that more money is spent on military pensions - including those accused of crimes during the dictatorship - than on social benefits. I also have joined OCCRP as their first Brazil editor and was responsible for coordinating cross-border investigations involving Brazil and other countries. One of the projects revealed multiple investigations against the giant Canadian group Brookfield for environmental crimes and threats against Brazilian citizens. In this other project, Open Lux, we have revealed how the mother of a Brazilian politician that is being investigated for corruption created an offshore in Luxembourg without l In the past, I was part of a team that broke a story revealing that a bid result was already set before the due date. It made a city save millions in public funds. Using public data, I found out that high-level officials received housing benefits ilegally from public universities for years.

Using social media data, I was able to investigate and highlight the most impactful disinformation network in Brazil during the 2018 presidential elections. They were reaching more people than famous artists like Anitta or Madonna. The story made Facebook shut their pages down a week later. I have also coordinated a series of articles that led government authorities to investigate and then shut down an illegal air charter service, seize illegal airplanes and sanction people and companies who were operating those services.

Hungary,"ATLO, Átlátszó",Small,Shortlist,,ATLO – Hungarian data and visual journalism,"ATLO is a Budapest-based visual journalism project. It was launched by Hungarian investigative journalism center Átlátszó in November 2018. Since then we created more than 60 projects for clients and for own purpose. Our works are often featured in local and international sites, television and radio channels, conferences and listings. The team currently is a duo of two data journalists and visualisation experts: Attila Bátorfy, who is head of team and creator of the ATLO project, and Krisztián Szabó.  Bátorfy has been working in the field of journalism since 2008, and has been working with data since 2014. He is a master teacher of journalism, media studies and information graphics at the Media Department of Eötvös Loránd University, and research fellow and data advisor at the Central European University's Center for Media, Data and Society and serve on the editorial board of Médiakutató, a quarterly scientific journal of Media Studies. For his journalistic work he was awarded with the Transparency-Soma Prize for the best investigative reporting, two Quality Journalism Prizes, the János Eörsi Memorial Award for the best economic investigative article and he received the Junior Prima Prize.  Szabó finished his masters degree at the Media Department of Eötvös Loránd University in media studies in 2021 summa cum laude. He is part of Átlátszó since May 2020, with the expertise in data journalism and data visualisation. He is also part of the graphic team ATLO. In 2021, he received the Junior Prima Prize for his journalistic work. Our work is seperated into two aspects: creating visualisation stories for our own purpose and for clients. in 2021, we created nine bigger projects (3 of which were for clients) and several smaller visualisations, maps, and experimental work. We also work as the data journalism team of investigative journalism center Átlátszó.  We are inspired by the country we live in: Hungary has great potential regarding data visualisation, and it is visible in the large share of projects we created over the years. We are also inspired by a international data journalism community and visualisation experts: some of our work and experiments this year were inspired by material we saw on the internet, mostly on Twitter.  ","Hungarian Money was a cross-border project supported by IJ4EU, where five investigative newsrooms from Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Croatia uncovered the international spendings of the Hungary-based Gábor Bethlen Fund. ATLO was behind the data analysis and visualisation in the articles,the site creation, and a general help to other contributors. The project was listed in a weeky collection of best data journalism projects by GIJN. Mosquito Monitor was a client work for the Hungarian Centre for Ecological Research. Their aim is to monitor the presence of invasive mosquito species. They have been collecting data for years, and they needed a website where this data could be presented in an appropriate and interactive way. Site building and visualisations, as well as data automatisation (via Google Sheets) was made by our team. We are still frequently doing maintenance work on the site, adding new charts and expanding the scope of the project. Alternative Budapest was a collaboration between ATLO and Budapest Brand. The aim of the project was to create an ""online issue"" mapping the web of cultural places located in Budapest. Data collection was made by the Budapet Brand team, our team was invited to the project to create interactive visualisations from the collected data. In the end, we created most of the site, added more functionality, uploaded articles to the ""application"" and helped the team during the launch phase of the project. A year of the pandemic (A járvány egy éve) is a custom-made scrollytelling visualisation, telling the story of the first year of covid in Hungary through the daily published data. The project was listed in a weeky collection of best visualisations by GIJN. Hungarian Oppositional Pre-elections of 2021: this project was an election-tracking website, that showed live-updated visualisations about the status of the Hungarian Pre-elections. The site also offered viewers additional visualisations and analytical articles about the background and preludes of the event. The site had 300 thousand visits with 170 thousand unique visitors during the two days of the vote count. It was also included in a weekly collection by Datawrapper. In a summertime project, we compiled the past 125 years of the Olympic Games, with the scope of all Hungarian medalists in the history of the Olympics.  We also created three experimental map-based works about certain aspects of Hungary: Climate Maps compiled several versions of Hungary, based on weather and human impact. Half Hour Distance was another experiment, showing in 3d ""coral-like"" formations how far away one can go by car from the capitals of each county. It was inspired by Craig Taylor's Coral Cities and was included in Datawrapper's weekly list. Hungary's Elevation Map showcases the elevation levels of Hungary by every 100 meter, with the inspiration from Alasdair Rae's tweet. It was included in Datawrapper's weekly list of interesting works. Here you can find an overview.  Apart from that we wrote more than 100 data-based articles in various topics and created around 700 charts and diagrams to those articles in the data journalism department of Átlátszó. ","English, Hungarian",https://atlo.team/atlo-team-english/,http://hungarianmoney.eu,https://szunyogmonitor.hu/index.php/szunyogmonitor-english/,https://terkep.alternativbudapest.hu/index.html,https://atlo.team/ajarvanyegyeve/,https://atlo.team/ellenzekielovalasztas/,https://atlo.team/olimpia125/,https://atlo.team/fel-orara/,https://atlo.team/domborzat/,https://atlo.team/idojaras-klima-es-emberi-tevekenyseg-terkepeken/,,,,,,,
Spain,The Washington Post,Big,Shortlist,,Adrián Blanco's portfolio,"Dear 2022 Sigma Awards Committee,  During the past few years as a Graphics reporter at The Washington Post, I've analyzed dozens of datasets and published dozens of pieces, hundreds of graphics and experimented with new ways for data to tell stories. ""Biden nominated as many minority women to be judges in four months as Trump had confirmed in four years"" and ""More than 1,700 congressmen once enslaved Black people"" are two pieces I have recently worked on that show complex analyses of hand-crafted databases, high-quality data visualizations and curated design. Over this time, I have become a better graphics reporter, widening my range of technical and visual skills. From my position in the newsroom, I have tried to promote collaboration, knowledge sharing and learning across the Graphics team and the newsroom. I have been part of the onboarding process of numerous colleagues, offering support and solving questions, teaching them the systems in place and making them feel welcome from the very first minute on the team. As a Graphics reporter, I always aim to create beautiful and well designed graphics that stop people from scrolling to take a deeper look and leave having learned something new and unexpected. I strongly believe on the use of highly curated visualizations to explain complex concepts such as redistricting, policy making or even election results that have an impact in our daily lives. As data and visual reporters, I believe we have the capacity to not only react to the news with explainers, but also push exclusive content and generate our own databases where no data exists. This piece titled  ""How the coronavirus exposed health disparities in communities of color"" is one that I worked on at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. It showcases my interest in pushing for more investigative, highly curated and uniquely presented content. I am fascinated by the possibilities the intersection of reporting, data and design offers to journalism. Not only do I put this combination of skills in practice on my own work,  but also advocate for it. In my free time, I have also mentored students and taught classes on these disciplines at Master's levels. Kind regards, Adrián Blanco Ramos adrianblancoramos.com","Dear 2022 Sigma Awards Committee,  My portfolio showcases my goal of innovation and thinking outside of the box for daily pieces to highly curated investigations. No matter the topic or the approach, my goal when working on a story or graphic is to create a ‘whoa’ factor for the reader.  In terms of presentation, I always pursue beautiful and well designed stories that stop people from scrolling to take a deeper look and leave having learned something new and unexpected. Examples of highly sophisitcated data visualizations include a population change cartogram I worked on for the Census 2020 state population release and an analysis on how America’s demographics are changing. The story included covering the abstraction of reality in the shape of a cartogram indicating demographic change thorough out the U.S.,  is truly unique as it encodes several variables such as population totals, shifts and growth. I followed a similar abstract concept on the second story where the mountains represent demographic change by county. Behind the scenes, I have developed a wide range of skills to analyze complex databases, identify the most important patterns in the database and prepare the main findings for publication. The analysis by race and gender of the federal judiciary in the U.S., as well as the investigation on the congressmen who once enslaved Black people are examples of sophisticated analyses based on hand-crafted datasets created in the newsroom for investigative purposes that I have worked on during the past year.. My portfolio also features a few courses and workshops on data visualization and data analysis that I taught over the past year. I find it incredibly rewarding to teach others and help them grow and develop their skills to become better reporters. The original topics, attention to the detail and the technical skills put into practice to create these pieces are some of the things I enjoy the most while reporting. I feel strongly that this portfolio reflects my passion and aim as a reporter.  Links to these stories and my work are attached.

Germany,Süddeutsche Zeitung,Big,Shortlist,,"Data Journalism of Süddeutsche Zeitung 2021 – Coronavirus, Climate Crisis and Elections","As for every journalist, this has been a challenging year for the Data Unit at Süddeutsche Zeitung, but also an exciting one. More than maybe ever we feel that we as journalists really made a difference, as we helped our readership making sense of what’s going on in the world. Three major issues dominated the lives of people in Germany in 2021: the ongoing pandemic, the climate crisis, which was clearly felt for the first time, and the federal elections. The virus is invisible to the naked eye, as are the changing climate and the political impact of algorithms and social networks for the most part, so looking at and interpreting the numbers is the best way to figure out where we are and what might come next.   Süddeutsche Zeitung is the leading daily quality newspaper in Germany. Founded 1945 and based in Munich, it offers reporting, analysis and opinion for a national audience. Editorial staff is 400+ people, with bureaus in Berlin, Frankfurt, Düsseldorf, Leipzig, Hamburg and Stuttgart, plus correspondents in major capitals all around the world. Its award-winning Data Team was established in 2018 to focus on data-driven reporting across all topics, with close links to the Investigations team (known for the Panama Papers, among other stories). Although it is a standalone unit of the newsroom, the team always works very closely with specialist editors from the other departments, graphic designers and developers, combining their expertise and skills with their own to achieve the best result for readers. As the team sees it, data journalism is first and foremost journalism - its goal is to tell stories, explain complex issues, expose injustice and corruption. The team is committed to constantly learning, experimenting with new tools, sources and storytelling formats, and providing the best possible experience for Süddeutsche Zeitung readers - online and in print. Exchanging ideas, sharing knowledge and learning from each other are important pillars of the philosophy. Towards their readers, they try to be as transparent as possible - publishing detailed descriptions of their methodology, source code and raw data wherever possible.   ","Coronavirus Dashboard: Keeping our readers up to date with the latest and, most importantly, accurate figures on the coronavirus pandemic is a matter of the heart for us - but also a lot of work. Our Coronavirus Dashboard, which we reworked this year, has been part of our homepage www.sueddeutsche.de since the beginning of the pandemic. Many figures also get adapted to a big, daily graphic in the print edition. Lack of data standards in Germany and frequently changing data formats have repeatedly led to difficulties in our automated pipelines.   Vaccination Bot: Several million people have viewed our dashboard, as well as our Vaccination Bot. We launched the Vaccination Bot in early 2021, at a time when there was little vaccine available. The rules were complicated as to who was first. With our interactive calculator, our readers could find out approximately when they could expect to get vaccinated.   Green, yellow, Corona: For this project we tried out a methodology that was completely new to us: sensor journalism. Using our own CO2 measuring devices, we measured how high the Corona contagion risk is at schools, kindergardens, offices and homes. And were able to show how to minimize the risk with proper ventilation.    The Climate Monitor: But there is a risk which is even more threatening than the current pandemic: the climate crisis. During the heavy floodings in Western Germany we published an elaborate storytelling about how the climate in Germany already changed. Since then we offer monthly updated analysis of the German weather and how it compares to the longterm average in our climate dashboard at sz.de/klima in detail for every single place in Germany.   The World on the Brink: In November, new emissions targets were adopted at COP26 in Glasgow. But these bare figures and often imprecise pledges are not easy to understand. In ""The World on the Brink"" we therefore described in concrete terms what it means for the world's climate if the pledges are not met, only partially met or met in full.   Federal Elections – The Analysis: Back to the present. As the world may have noticed, the year 2021 marked neither the end of the pandemic nor of climate change, but it did mark the end of Angela Merkel. Olaf Scholz was elected as the new German Chancellor. Again, we used a new technique: natural language generation (NLG). With our automatically generated texts and graphics, we were able to provide our readers with a very detailed election analysis for each constituency shortly after the election.   Politics on Facebook, Distorted world: Much of the federal election campaign was conducted on social networks. To understand their influence on the elections, we teamed up with the US nonprofit newsroom The Markup. Together, we implemented their Facebook Inspector called Citizen Browser in Germany. Via this international cooperation, we were able to show how different Facebook looked like to people with different political attitudes.    The hatred grows: In 2021, the pandemic also spurred radicalization in Germany. Protests against the COVID restrictions escalated as protesters teamed up with players of the German Far Right. They mainly use Telegram, a platform that does not moderate or sanction hate speech. To monitor this threat, we scraped 12 million messages from possibly radical groups and channels. We built our own dictionary of more than 2000 words that indicate different aspects of hate speech. Using this, we were able to describe how the usage of hate speech not only increased within a year of Telegram messaging – but also how the words the people used shifted from demagogy to conspiracy fables.   ",German,https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ZPVb3rd_11ywIPGNc8KTBslnGb9K7Xj/view?usp=sharing,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/wissen/coronavirus-die-wichtigsten-daten-in-grafiken-e536967/,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/wissen/archiv-impfbot-wann-waeren-sie-dran-gewesen-e927398/,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/wissen/mit-co2-ampeln-gegen-corona-e452127/,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/wissen/klimawandel-aktuell-der-sz-klimamonitor-e203859/,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/wissen/nach-der-cop26-welt-am-abgrund-e488967/,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/bundestagswahl-wahlkreise-ergebnisse-1.5417929,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/politik/politik-auf-facebook-verzerrte-welt-e883580/,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/politik/radikalisierung-in-der-corona-krise-e742536/,,,,,,,,
United States,"Pulitzer Center with Macaranga - Malaysia and SouthEast Asia Globe (republication), Bloomberg - US, Philippine Center of Investigative Journalism, The Intercept - Brasil and Mongabay (republication), Tempo - Indonesia, The New York Times, NBC, EL Pais",Big,Shortlist,,RAINFOREST INVESTIGATIONS NETWORK,"The Rainforest Investigations Network (RIN) is a collaborative investigative journalism initiative founded in 2020. Led by the Pulitzer Center, the network brings together journalists to expose the causes and powers behind the destruction of the planet's major rainforests in the Amazon, the Congo Basin, and Southeast Asia. We believe the network is an innovative and unique effort to improve coverage of one of the most important issues today: the destruction of ecosystems and the implications for biodiversity and climate change. To achieve this goal we have a strong focus on data analysis and sharing information inside and outside  the network, facilitating transnational collaborative journalism, building capacity, and creating long-lasting impact. In its first year, RIN selected 13 journalists from 10 countries, who as Investigative Fellows dedicate themselves for a whole year to projects that mix fieldwork and building sources with data analysis. This gives them the unique opportunity to work solely on rainforest issues and complete projects they otherwise would not be able to do.  Twelve of the Fellows work from the three rainforest regions and one works in an international context because of the global importance of the issue. Their outlets include  local, regional and international newsrooms, providing unique opportunities for global data collaborations. With the support of the network, the Fellows were able to overcome challenges with obtaining governmental information in Colombia, lining up flight information with satellite imagery of air strips in the Amazon, tracking supply chains from Indonesia to the U.S., and untangling complex corporate structures financing environmental damage in the Congo Basin. Our network highlights how ecologically important regions are threatened by supply chains connected to consumers in developed countries. These chains, supported by large multinational companies and governments, are often linked to illegal exploitation of natural resources such as agricultural commodities and timber. Sometimes they are even linked to organized crime, as with gold mines in Venezuela and Brazil. It is because of this global nature that RIN relies heavily on the power of sharing data to communicate the scale of this problem. We believe that this is the only way to truly reveal the complexities in a systematic way. In addition to the Fellows, the network has an editorial team of experienced investigative and environmental journalists, including an environmental investigations editor, a data editor and an editorial coordinator. With constant support from the Pulitzer Center’s senior editors and outreach teams, the editors closely follow the investigative projects and provide not only editorial advice, but also access to databases, analysis tools and other investigative resources. . In the past year, the network organized eight training sessions on data analysis, uncovering supply chains and reading financial documents, for example, tailored to the varying levels of investigative experience among the Fellows. As the initiative reports on territorial transformations caused by environmental degradation, the use of high resolution satellite imagery has proved to be one of the most important methodologies for us. In its first year, RIN has produced over a dozen in-depth investigations that have already had impact in the countries in which they were published. The stories are based on extensive research of public documents and have been produced with multidisciplinary teams of journalists, data scientists, and environmental science researchers. In Malaysia, Indonesia and Brazil, companies and governments have responded immediately to the revelations brought by the reports, proving the power of investigative journalism based on rigorous data analysis. RIN is a network that will continue to grow through the selection of new Fellows. At the same time we will continue to look for ways to contribute to training and sharing data journalism methodologies.","This portfolio includes eight investigations selected from the almost 40 stories produced by the first group of Rainforest Investigations Network Fellows, which reached almost five million readers. Story 1 - Pahang Deforestation Adds to Decades of Indigenous Land Rights Struggle in Malaysia Published by Macaranga in partnership with the Southeast Asia Globe. Fellow Yao Hua Law analyzed hundreds of environmental permit documents and found how a Malaysian logging company was infringing on the land of an Indigenous community. The reporter compared satellite images to illustrate the rapidly advancing deforestation at the site. Because of these revelations, the community took legal steps to block the project and the permit was withdrawn. Story 2 - Amazon Fast Approaching Point of No Return This report by Jessica Brice published on the cover of Bloomberg's Business Week magazine looks at the mechanisms of illegal land grabbing in the Brazilian Amazon. By consolidating public databases and scraping information from PDFs, the report shows the intricate legal gray zone that involves local politicians and the agribusiness presence in Brazil's National Congress. Story 3 - Greed for Gold Originally published in Portuguese by Hyury Potter at Intercept Brasil, it exposes irregular gold mining conducted by company Gana Gold in the state of Pará. The reporter obtained documents from Brazil's National Mining Agency and showed that the operations had no environmental licensing. He showed the destruction caused by the mining company with high-resolution satellite images obtained with the help of RIN. After publication, the company was fined. Story 4 - Irresponsible Food State This long investigative report by Indonesia’s Tempo magazine shows how economic recovery plans launched during the pandemic are generating deforestation. Through field trips with the use of digital maps and drones, the reporter showed that the development areas proposed by the government in Kalimantan have not been respected and have advanced into areas that are supposed to have protection. The story was used as an example of how Indonesia does not uphold deforestation pledges at the UN climate talks in Glasgow.  Story 5 - How Americans' Appetite for Leather in Luxury SUVs Worsens Amazon Deforestation Published by Fellow Manuela Andreoni in The New York Times, this story follows in detail the leather supply chain starting from the Brazilian Amazon rainforest to the suppliers for some of the top U.S. carmakers, which she uncovered through analyzing cattle purchase and sale document data. After publication, a local court in Brazil mentioned the story to argue for changing regulation.  Story 6 - Palawan Authorities Rezone Forest to Allow Mining A co-publication of the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism and NBC, this series looks at the nickel supplied for electric vehicle battery production in the U.S. The field reporting along with analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery shows that expansion plans on the island of Palawan in the Philippines will worsen an already complicated situation for local communities. Story 7 - This Fabric is Hailed as 'Eco-friendly.' The Rainforest Tells a Different Story Led by RIn Fellow Andy Lehren, the NBC investigative team and RIN colleagues at Tempo Indonesia used digital mapping and high-resolution satellite images to reveal the connection between illegal deforestation in Indonesia and the production of clothing with viscose fabric, used by international fashion retailers.  Story 8 - The Colonial Network of Palm Oil Plantations in the Democratic Republic of Congo Fellows Gloria Pallares (EL PAIS) and Madeleine Ngeunga (InfoCongo) teamed up to show the companies behind environmental destruction in the DRC. With the help of RIN editors and financial specialists hired by RIN, they untangled a complex corporate web to find who is financing the destruction. ","English, Bahasa Malaysia, Portuguese, Spanish, Bahasa Indonesia",https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/pahang-deforestation-adds-decades-indigenous-land-rights-struggle-malaysia,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/amazon-fast-approaching-point-no-return,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/200-million-gold-extracted-amazon-mine-through-illegal-licenses,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/irresponsible-food-estate,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/how-americans-appetite-leather-luxury-suvs-worsens-amazon-deforestation,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/palawan-authorities-rezone-forest-allow-mining,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/fabric-hailed-eco-friendly-rainforest-tells-different-story,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/colonial-network-palm-oil-plantations-democratic-republic-congo,,,,,,,,,
Argentina,LA NACION (Argentina),Big,Winner,"Once again in 2021, La Nacion Data served as a model for news organizations around the world. In a country without a freedom of information law, La Nation Data continues to find creative ways to acquire data and tell stories of significance. Whether through crowdsourcing or collaboration, La Nacion simply finds new and creative ways to get the story. The jury singled out La Nacion's creative use of computer vision, AI and crowdsourcing to monitor paper election ballots in a country where votes are counted manually. They found no fraud but did put politicians on notice that this ground journalists, students and NGOs were watching. Truly incredible work.",LA NACION DATA,"In October 2010, after an ONA pre conference workshop “Data Journalism for Beginners”, we launched LA NACION DATA as a newsroom strategy. We dreamt big, started small, and never stopped. Our beginnings were really challenging. Argentina was a country without FOIA law and no open data policies. We started gathering allies from within the company but also making bonds with the incipient Hacks/Hackers, open data, open government and data science initiatives. To accelerate change we hosted 4 Datafest public events in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016 and strengthened  learnings on opening, analyzing and visualizing data of public interest generated by different stakeholders (government, multilateral organizations, academia, media, NGos, etc). Collaboration is in our DNA. We started in 2012 for our news application on statement of assets working with transparency NGOs until the launch of our Environment Legislator Monitor in 2021. We also partner with other  newsrooms in national (Chequeado), latinamerican (Red Palta) and international (ICIJ, Journalism AI collab) areas. We went massive with crowdsourcing developing our open source, online and collaborative platform Vozdata with the support of Knight Mozilla OpenNews and Civicus. Since 2014, we have used it to digitize and make databases from scratch with 10.000 PDFs of Senate expenses, 40.000 phone interceptions’ audios and 16.000 Elections documents PDFs.  This year we used the platform to audit a computer vision algorithm preselected 30.000 PDFs documents with the help of 300 volunteers. Our scope includes data driven investigations, data as a service and “data-teinment”.  We are a team of 12  journalists,  data scientists, developers and designers. We  usually work in  collaboration with the Graphics department for big projects. Our main inspiration through the last 11 years came from  Propublica, The Guardian UK, Los Angeles Times, NYTimes, WaPo, Civio (Spain), The Economist, Reuters, Ojo Publico, Texty.  We usually got ideas from conferences like NICAR, ONA, GEN Summit, Abrelatam, Hacks/Hackers Argentina, WIDS and data journalism books. Mentors: Knight Mozilla OpenNews, EJC, JSK at Stanford University, Prof. Rosental Alves and lately from, PolisLSE Journalism AI Collab.","2021 Highlights [Climate & Biodiversity Crisis]: Our herculean effort to visualize impossible unstructured data from Congress bills projects related to climate and biodiversity crisis. The Legislative Environmental Monitor is based on a huge database made from scratch and updated periodically from unstructured text. This tool is helpful to understand the law enactment process, monitor the advance of bills in an opaque context and provide a public service for the audience to demand specific measures against the climate & biodiversity crisis. This application was made by LA NACION Data together with four NGOs ‒one of them, a specialist in legislative matters‒ and the other three are local references in environmental topics.  [AI + Crowdsourcing] Our first Computer Vision project for monitoring Elections documentation in a country where votes are counted manually and there are multiple paper options as political parties participate in primaries or general elections, (it could go to + 15 different options to count in some districts). The purpose of the project was to monitor telegrams with computer vision and then validate data provided by the algorithm using crowdsourcing.  [AI + Text]: Our first NLP and machine learning project analyzing 600 hundred lyrics from trap music. Trap is one of the most popular music genres among young people in Argentina. We used Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to analyze their lyrics, demystify the concepts around the genre and understand what these artists, who bring about such a furor among the new generations, are talking about.  [Legislative Elections pack]. Electoral coverage presents the challenge of innovating on an event that takes place in the country every two years. At LA NACION we developed more than ten pieces with great visual and interactive power to provide a public service and guarantee a differential consumption experience for the newspaper's audience. At the same time, we guarantee the detailed analysis of the large volume of data (more than 24.4 million votes distributed in 379 departments, 135 districts and 15 municipalities) and its comparison with previous elections, whose data are stored in a large historical database. [Corruption in Vaccination against Covid]: The vaccination campaign against COVID in Argentina had irregularities since its inception. Less than two months after it began, a corruption scandal known as the ""VIP vaccination center"" came to light: government officials, family members and those closest to the government had received doses before the prioritized groups. We decided to follow the campaign and the vaccination system from two different sides. On the one hand, control the number of doses received, distributed and applied. On the other hand, monitor the implementation of public policies by combining public data and many requests for access to public information as main sources. [Real Economy Monitor (MER)]: Argentina is within the Top 5 countries in the world regarding inflation. Our domestic and hyperregulated economy lives with 7 different types of US dollars conversion rate to Argentina’s pesos. MER is an invaluable tool for our readers to follow for free more than 80 indicators. Data as a service maintained by LN Data team.

Russia,Important Stories,Small,Winner,"Alesya Marokhovskaya and her colleagues at Important Stories’ data department use advanced techniques and creative data strategies to turn numbers into incredibly important stories for the Russian public. They are selfless journalists who have inspired others, shared code, and helped with data processing for numerous local media outlets in the country. The outstanding and world-class data works authored by Alesya and her team at istories are developed by dedicated investigative journalists who work every day with a huge target on their back. Since selecting istories and Alesya as winners of the Sigma awards, the Kremlin has designated Important Stories as an “undesirable organization”, a categorization that means istories journalists can be sentenced to jail if they carry on with their journalism. The people sharing their data investigations can be fined or sentenced to jail, too. The youngest data department in Russian media has known pressure before, as it was designated last summer a “foreign agent” in Russia, but they kept their focus and went on in exposing abuses in the country’s judiciary, politics, problems in its housing allocation system as well as serious mismanagement and fraud in the healthcare and education sectors.",Important Stories (IStories),"Important Stories is a small (20 people) young Russian media that was founded by investigative journalists and data journalists. Data journalism is one of the most important areas for Important Stories. (you can switch the language of the site to English, we specially translate some of our important articles into English)  We have the youngest data department in Russia — only one year old, but it contains the most experienced russian journalists who have worked and collaborated with major independent Russian media (Novaya Gazeta, Medusa, RBC), participated in major international projects (Pandora Papers, Troika Landromat, FinCEN files, OpenLux  and much more). All of us are young data-journalists (from 24 to 28 years old) with 2-5 years of experience in data journalism.  The peculiarity of our materials is that we are always looking for human stories, we see in the data not just numbers, but a person. We choose the most important and dangerous topics for research, which are practically not taken up by other Russian media. For example, we investigate the falsification of criminal cases by the police, environmental problems, health problems, fraud in State Duma elections and much more.  Also at each meeting we discuss which stories from around the world inspire us to do something similar for our country.  In addition, each of us knows at least one programming language to solve interesting technical problems in order to extract and analyze data even where it seems that it is impossible. We are always happy to share our skills with others, so we often make training videos ""How we did it"" based on our materials (you can check our Workshops). We are open to sharing data and code. That is, we not only try to make high-quality data materials, but also share our knowledge.   Our data team: Alesya Marokhovskaya (editor and data-journalist) Sonya Savina (data-journalist) Polina Uzhvak (data-journalist) Irina Dolinina (data-journalist) Julia Alykova (data-journalist) Katya Bonch-Osmolovskaya (data-journalist) As the editor of our Data Department, I believe that not only the entire department can be awarded, but each of the authors can be separately marked as a Young Talent.  Besides, journalism in Russia is going through dark times. For our investigations and research, the Russian government has labeled IStories as a foreign agent, so we are working under the heaviest pressure. But we don't want to stop and plan to continue making many important data stories.","This is a story about how the police use the same fake witnesses in cases for drug crimes. IStories have downloaded 56,860 documents from the website of the Moscow City Court. Next step was challenging: we needed to extract names from the text. So we used Python for this task. Then, again, with the help of programming, we found names that are repeated in several cases. Then we read all the documents ourselves and collected evidence. We managed to find 142 such witnesses. 2. Using the scrollytelling technique IStories shows on charts and laws of mathematics why and how the results of the Duma elections in September 2021 could have been falsified and what role electronic voting played in those falsifications. 3. According to the International Labor Organization, there are between 500 and 1000 non-fatal accidents at production facilities and enterprises for one accident resulted in the death. In Russia there are only 22 non-fatal accidents per death. This is an indicator of incomplete data. 4. Russian readers don't like to read about the climate, but we have found a convenient way to tell about it simply, clearly and on data. So for this story we used the scrollytelling technique. And it worked. It turned out to be one of the most widely read stories for IStories about ecology. 5. In this data story we discovered that 100 000 schoolchildren who are due to a school bus, are not provided with it. Not all families in Russian regions have a car, so kids have to walk to school along a highway, through forest, dangerous railroad crossing, off-road or snowdrifts. To find populated places situated far from schools we made a script in Python which matches a place with the closest school and shows the distance between them. 6. In autumn 2021, the Russian media began to write a lot about the fact that migrants commit many crimes in Russia. The Ministry of Internal Affairs said that this is deliberately done by media recognized as «foreign agents». Therefore, using programming, neural networks and open data, we checked which media actually incite hatred — it turned out that these are pro-state media. And we have refuted the widespread myths that migrants are dangerous criminals. 7. We examined all available government data on air pollution, environmental standards, federal programs and ecoactivists’ works. We found out  that  standards were loosened, the state monitoring of atmospheric pollution covers only a fifth of all Russian cities and does not track all emissions. The results of such measurement cannot be reliable. 8. We have proved that 20 million Russians may not be able to wait for an ambulance to arrive. We calculated the travel time from each settlement to the nearest medical institution. To build routes, we collected the coordinates of settlements and the nearest medical facilities. Then we use Python for each locality searches for the nearest medical facility and calculates the distance to it and the time on the road. 9. We analyzed data on queues for apartments in Russian regions and found that 54% of all Russian families have been waiting in queue for housing for ten or more years. We investigated how it can affect ""children of the GULAG"" and found that they could never wait to return from exile because of the queues. 10. Every year it loses 150-200 historical heritage objects. As a result over the past 10 years 2.5 thousand national attractions were lost. We analyzed the registers of historical heritage objects and found out that the regional authorities deprive architectural monuments of their protected status.","English, Russian",https://istories.media/en/investigations/2021/02/18/im-a-witness-who-helps-the-police-to-fabricate-drug-related-cases/,https://istories.media/en/investigations/2021/03/31/expendables-of-the-quota-system/,https://istories.media/en/investigations/2021/06/10/im-so-tired-of-burying-my-friends/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/10/19/warm-arctic-hot-siberia/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/05/14/schools-accessibility/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/11/23/how-propagandists-incite-hatred-towards-migrants-and-the-ministry-of-internal-affairs-accuses-foreign-agents-of-doing-so/,https://istories.media/investigations/2021/08/05/dad-help-me-im-suffocating-why-the-russian-environmental-monitoring-system-does-not-work/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/07/26/they-have-been-re-optimized-to-the-point-that-soon-no-one-will-be-able-to-get-sick-at-all/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/01/19/to-stand-in-a-queue-for-thirty-years-we-will-stay-alive-in-despite/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/11/29/historical-heritage-loss/,,,,,,,
Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Shortlist,,Stephanie Adeline,"I am a journalist for The Straits Times digital graphics team. Since I joined the team in 2020, I have dedicated my time to understanding large, complicated datasets and presenting them through simple, comprehenible charts, maps and other creative visualisations.  My goal as a journalist is to detangle complex issues and explain them in a way that is accessible to our readers. In 2021, one of my focuses was visualising the urgency of climate action.  My biggest project of the year, “Saving Singapore’s Shores,” was a data story on sea-level rise in Singapore. We visualised different sea-level rise scenarios using 3D simulations and Singapore’s iconic landmark, the Merlion, as a scale. It was the fruit of several months of sifting through climate reports, discussions with researchers and finally building the 3D models and going through numerous revisions to ensure accuracy.  Throughout the year, I have successfully led the team in many quick-turnaround projects, despite working remotely and being based in a different country than most of the team. At the start of the year, I was able to set up Covid-19 vaccine trackers quickly. When Singapore’s decennial census report came out, I led the team in producing a data report in just two days. When the IPCC report was released, we also published our data story within a week of the report's release date.  Over the past year, I have acquired a number of new skills in my toolbelt. From honing my design skills, learning new tools for data analysis, debugging errors much faster, to improving my writing skills, I have become a more well-rounded data journalist. I have also participated and spoken at several data journalism events and workshops this year.  I have also worked with several interns on our team, welcoming them and guiding them through, for many of them, their first experience in data journalism. It is also through interacting with them that I picked up new skills such as video editing, animating illustrations and creating 3D graphics.  One of the most biggest lessons I learned this year is the importance of collaboration. In order to produce compelling, visual data stories, a data journalist cannot work in silo. They need the help of beat reporters who are well-versed in their topic and the expertise of researchers in academia who dedicate their lives to the area. And of course, to get a project off the ground, journalists need the help of an exceptional team of designers, developers and editors. I look forward to working on more collaborative, innovative data and visual stories in 2022.","Saving Singapore's Shores: An interactive 3D exploration of sea level rise as a  result of climate change, it's impacts on Singapore and possible solutions.

United States,The Marshall Project,Big,Shortlist,,Weihua Li,"To the Judges:  This part of your application must explain why you think you should be considered for this award. Tell us about your career path, number of years in the field, inspiration, ideas and mentors. If you are submitting the portfolio of an organization, tell us the same information about the organization.  Weihua Li’s data reporting investigates the criminal justice system, challenges mainstream myths about crime and punishment, and empowers community members to use data to hold the powerful accountable. Li’s journalism journey started when her college professor sent their class to cover the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the brothers responsible for the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. For someone born and raised in China, the idea that she could just set foot in a federal courtroom and report on one of the most high profile cases was unimaginable – and addictive. Li graduated from Boston University with degrees in journalism and political science. She joined the inaugural data journalism program at Columbia Journalism School, where she studied under respected journalists like Giannina Segnini and Mark Hansen.  Her masters’ thesis focused on the school-to-prison pipeline in the New York public school system, where her analysis and reporting on the school disciplinary data showed children with disabilities — especially those who came from poor families — are far more likely to be disciplined because the school staff cannot accommodate their emotional needs. Since joining The Marshall Project three years ago, she has used data to help our readers to make sense of the criminal justice system. The work has always been meaningful, but the combination of the unfolding crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, racial justice protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd, and the surging homicide rate have made her criminal data analysis more important than ever. Over the past year Li analyzed how the surge in homicide disproportionately affects communities of color, debunked the myth about police officers leaving the profession in droves, led a deep dive into the striking disparities in how many Black girls are hurt by the police, and built an interactive database that shows where people are incarcerated across the country, which empowered many local reporters to investigate their own communities. In myriad ways, Li’s data storytelling has deepened our understanding of criminal justice trends.  For providing nuanced data-storytelling that is accessible to communities grappling with questions around what safety means to them, and for helping individuals who have experienced injustice place their experiences within broader contexts, I am proud to nominate Weihua Li for the Sigma Portfolio Award.  Sincerely, David Eads Senior Data Editor","Weihua Li's 2021 portfolio—in some cases as lead data reporter in larger projects, in others creating her own stories—shows a rare level of breadth and creativity. Her personal projects were impactful and forward-thinking: Her investigation with Ilica Mahajan comparing a common law enforcement narrative to what labor statistics show about police employment was one of the most well-read pieces on The Marshall Project website with more than 100,000 unique visitors. The story, co-published by Time Magazine, led to coverage by NPR, NBC, and more, and was widely cited and debated. It was also our best-performing stor on social media in 2021. Her fresh take on evidence of an uptick in anti-Asian harassment was translated into Chinese in local New York City publications and elicited a statement from Andrew Yang, then a candidate for mayor. Even a straightforward story about decennial census incarceration was accompanied by a data release that has led to at least three more local stories in other outlets. Li also acted as lead data reporter on several of The Marshall Project's signature investigations in 2021. Her work was a foundational element of these stories. She brought sophisticated geographic analysis to show the scale of shootings by police in rural communities. As a complement to a larger project, she developed an original data product and data release to show whether your state takes federal benefits intended for foster children. Both the story and data are driving reform. Michigan banned the state from pocketing federal benefits owed kids in foster care, while lawmakers in Nebraska, Montana, and Texas are taking a critical look at the practice in their jurisdictions. Our data also is being used by reporters to examine what is going on in their states. The Philadelphia Inquirer, for example, used findings from our investigation to examine their city's record—and found that Philadelphia had pocketed $5 million meant for local kids in foster care. Li requested, scraped, and joined data from several states that served as the spine of a series of stories about life without parole. For example, the data showed that nearly a quarter of people serving life without parole in the United States are imprisoned in Florida—13,600 people. One reason is a two-strikes law which requires maximum punishment for people who commit a felony within three years of leaving prison, even for burglary or other nonviolent crimes. Finally, she cleaned, normalized, and analyzed data from five police departments to investigate the use of force on children. One of the big challenges with this data were many issues with quality that created serious limitations. She not only had to wrangle and report the data, but manage expectations and find creative editorial approaches to the many things the data did not show. As her editor, I also want to point out that she accomplished all this as a new mother during a pandemic. These are challenging times, and she met those challenges with great skill and good cheer. More than anything, Li's work asks deep and critical questions: What is justice and how do we measure it? What are the harms caused by the system? Are the stories we hear about crime and criminal justice true? How can we deepen a polarized and politicized discourse with evidence?

Singapore,Reuters,Big,Shortlist,,Reuters portfolio,"Reuters tell their most important stories visually. Many pieces follow a narrative driven expressly by visual journalism, whether that is unique data gathering techniques, charting and data walk-throughs, satellite journalism, explainer illustrations or immersive presentations. Regardless of subject matter, project size, or reporting methods, data journalism plays a major role in delivering stories. Making data understandable One of our missions is to make complex or difficult data sets easily digestible to tell stories. Design is a key component of making difficult data accessible. For example, our project explaining ""What's in the skies over Kabul"", combines complicated subject matter and thousands of flight data points to clearly explain how different types of aircraft worked in unison to evacuate the Afghan capital. Our project on summer temperatures at the Tokyo Olympics also leverages large amounts of historic data to clearly explain the concerns around extreme heat at the games. Public service Getting timely information about the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine and putting the mountain of statistics in context for readers is at the core of public service journalism. Our COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker is a global effort to track the vaccine rollout plans of over 80 countries and all 50 U.S. states. Readers can see global and regional trends, dig deep into their own country, or read the statistics and headlines generated by our algorithm, fed by constantly changing data. Another example is the “Anatomy of a Death Threat” project, a data investigation which shows how Trump supporters waged a campaign of intimidation against the state and local officials who administer U.S. elections.  Innovation The Reuters Graphics team is continuously thinking of ways to push the boundaries of reporting and gathering information, such as our coverage of the Kabul crisis and the series of projects looking at sand mining. The team is constantly experimenting with striking ways to deliver our stories too. Take our project on rainforest deforestation for example. Animations show the actual scale and speed at which we are losing rainforest globally. Strong emphasis on project design Reuters pays careful consideration to the tone and subject matter as expressed through the design of the story. Reuters strives to forge a visual connection between audience and content before they have read a single word. The design and feel of each piece often reflects the tone and subject matter. This can be seen across a range of our work, such as the Eurovision project and the piece looking at bats and the origin of virus outbreaks.  Breaking news coverage When major news breaks, such as natural or unexpected disasters, colleagues from all aspects of the newsroom join forces to work with the graphics desk. Data, deep reporting and powerful presentation create insightful explainers that give the reader everything they need to know about the situation. Our job is to tell stories, and to further understanding of the news. We believe data, design, and narrative need to connect with the reader to bridge this. Reuters strives for this balance in every piece of visual journalism we undertake.","Bats and outbreaks As the WHO reached its findings on the origins of the novel coronavirus, Reuters explained why bats make such ideal hosts for disease-causing viruses. We visualised the universe of bat species and connected the dots to show the history of viruses they harboured, the intermediate hosts and connection to humans.   Flights over Kabul A Reuters analysis of flight data explained the rush to evacuate Kabul following the government collapse and Taliban takeover. We revealed how helicopter activity shifted from embassy evacuations to movement around a secretive CIA base. The analysis revealed how aircraft played different roles in the complex effort. This in-depth analysis was produced on deadline as events were unfolding.   Reuters Vaccine Tracker Reuters launched a global effort to track the vaccine rollout plans of over 80 countries and all U.S. states. We collected, verified and updated information on availability and eligibility as plans were announced and implemented around the world at a level of detail that has only been collected by Reuters to date. In addition to the data feeding our tracker page, Reuters partnered with Amazon to make the data available to Alexa users, giving answers on their local rollout.   Devoured This project is part of a series of visual stories examining how a construction boom is driving unregulated sand mining around the world – eroding rivers and coastlines, disrupting ecosystems and hurting livelihoods. Satellite-derived data revealed the scale of destruction at China’s largest freshwater lake. Reuters were able to visualise the millions of tonnes of sand sucked from the bed and shores, devastating the lake’s ability to function.   Death threats Reuters collected over 850 threatening messages sent to election workers. This visceral piece looks at the language and legality of these threats across a variety of forms: audio, charts and maps as well as an interactive quiz component to enforce the nuances in determining what is prosecutable and what is considered protected speech. This story is an unparalleled look at a targeted campaign of fear against election workers.   Ethiopia dams A Reuters analysis explained the critical issues surrounding the building of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam in the headwaters of the Nile River. The reporting and data traced how the project near Ethiopia's border with Sudan has ignited decade's old water rights issues.   Rainforest deforestation Tropical rainforests are home to at least half the world’s living species, yet humans are destroying it faster than any other type of woodland. This data-driven story uses 3D animation and graphics to visualise the scale of loss since 2002.   Eurovision Every year more than 200 million viewers watch the EuroVision Song Contest. In its 65th year, Reuters investigated how the contest changed with the times. Using the Spotify API, we analyzed hundreds of EuroVision tracks for their mood, energy and more. We traced the shifting arc of the contest, from the dance-happy hits of the '80s, to the power ballads of the '90s.   Summer Heat The Tokyo Olympics were held in a historically hot period for the host city. This rich data-driven analysis looked to highlight how the heat and humidity of Tokyo could put athletes at an elevated risk for heat illness.   500,000 lives lost To mark the terrifying milestone of 500,000 lives lost in the U.S. to COVID-19, Reuters created a single long visualization to represent every single death. This story uses elegant design and heartbreaking detail to humanize a tragedy of unimaginable scale. Other newsrooms had to choose between showing the complete cost of the disease or highlighting the individuals behind the story. The visualization in this piece manages to do",English,https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/BATS/qzjpqglbxpx/,https://graphics.reuters.com/AFGHANISTAN-CONFLICT/KABUL-AIRPORT/zjpqkkwmypx/,https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/vaccination-rollout-and-access/,https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-ENVIRONMENT/SAND-POYANG/qzjpqxxabvx/,https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/THREATS/mopanwmlkva/,https://graphics.reuters.com/ETHIOPIA-DAM/movanmkbmpa/,https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-DEFORESTATION/RAINFOREST/klvykzrbxvg/,https://graphics.reuters.com/MUSIC-EUROVISION/FINAL/rlgvdyeqzpo/,https://graphics.reuters.com/OLYMPICS-2020/SUMMER-HEAT/bdwvkogrzvm/,https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/USA-CASUALTIES-CHRONOLOGY/xklpyomnrpg/,,,,,,,
Russia,Important Stories,Small,Shortlist,,Alesya Marokhovskaya,"My name is Alesya Marokhovskaya, I am 26 years old. I have been doing data journalism and investigative journalism in Russia since I was 20 years old. I used to work in the data department of Novaya Gazeta, now I run the data department in Important Stories. This is a young media created by investigative journalists (Roman Anin, Olesya Shmagun). I've been working in Important stories since the beginning. And I see a special approach to data stories: they should always be about people, no matter how much data you have studied for this. You can see this approach in my stories. In addition, I know several programming languages. I especially like Python, and JavaScript for visualizations. Now it is difficult to engage in investigative journalism and data journalism in Russia. The Russian government invented the status of a ""foreign agent"" to silence independent media. Important stories and I am personally recognized as a foreign agent, but I want to believe that people in Russia and in the world can still see and appreciate our work.","In this portfolio, I tried to collect the most important works for me, where you can see interesting work with data (by the way, if we see that we can share our skills and tell how we did this project, then we are shooting a lesson for our Workshop — https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVZy5a_8sMo4ncI6XBb5iMQ ), interesting data visualizations (for example scrollytelling technique and, of course, an interesting story about people.

Spain,elDiario.es,Big,Shortlist,,elDiario.es data team,"elDiario.es is a digital news site which has become a major reference in current affairs for a new generation of Spanish readers, and also a pioneer in high quality content and innovative business model worldwide. Launched in the middle of the financial crisis in 2012 with no big investors or corporates backing it - just a bunch of journalists and their savings - elDiario.es has developed a community-based journalism model reaching mainstream audiences with scarce resources. Among the dozens of new digital projects born in the past decade in Spain, elDiario.es stands out. More than 12M unique users per month (ComScore Mmx) now read eldiario.es and that figure grows every month. And elDiario.es is the most widely read native digital media outlet in Spain, according to the Spanish Sociological Research Center. The key business innovation is the 'membership program' - more than 60.000 people (""socios"") already give financial support to elDiario.es in order to strengthen our editorial and economic independence. But it is not a paywall: the ""socios"" of elDiario.es do not pay to read the news, they pay for the information to be freely spread and thus gain social impact. They pay to belong to a community of citizens sharing values like equality, democratization, social justice and more importantly, the need for independent journalism.  Our business model has remained the same since our foundation, but when the coronavirus crisis hit, the media experienced financial difficulties. In order to handle this situation,  we decided to bearly change our business model and make an evolution of it always keeping our foundational principles: elDiario.es will continue to be free for those who cannot pay but it will be necessary to be a member to read elDiario.es regularly.   In a world where manipulation and propaganda advance, we do not want our journalism to be left behind a wall that excludes people based on their income. This evolution in our business model has brought to our community 18,000 new members and thousands of existing readers stepped in. Thanks to them elDiario.es is also a profitable company. Nowadays, our community represents more than 50% of our annual income. And in order to be fully transparent with their contribution, we annually publish our financial accounts. This good practice has become an expected date for the audience who perceives us as a trustful and reliable newsroom. Since its inception, elDiario.es has opted for data journalism as a way to create quality content for subscribers and also to reach new audiences in Spain. Since 2015, our data team has always been a small data unit with at least two journalists who have based their work on constant collaboration with the entire newsroom. Now, the data journalism team is formed by 3 journalists.  This year, our Covid-19 and vaccination coverage proves that this team has had a public service role. First, using data analysis, interactive narrative, and visualization of complex issues to make them understandable, and second, as an early warning of the evolution of the epidemic for our readers. In fact, the 3 most read pieces of news of the year in elDiario.es were created by the data team: our covid trackers.  And also this year we published big investigations and visual stories beyond Covid-19 about employment, social inequalities, climate change and urbanism. Precisely, our work philosophy has always been to visualize and explain things in the simplest way to the reader and collaborate with all the journalists in the newsroom to search stories and do better, accessible and understandable data journalism.  ","This is the 2021 coverage by the data unit of elDiario.es, formed by Raúl Sánchez, Ana Ordaz and Victòria Oliveres, of the first year after the COVID-19 pandemic. All the pieces that integrate this portfolio have been carried out working from home in 3 different cities, a challenge that has ended with a rewarding and useful result for the public. In fact, only our COVID-19 trackers sums around the 2% of elDiario.es total views in 2021. The team's work during the year has been conditioned by tracing the pandemic. We have continued to update every day and every week of the year the visualizations of the evolution of the new waves of cases and deaths in Spain and the world, always improving the pieces according to the informative interest of each moment. This year, we also included our tracker on the vaccination campaign against Covid-19. The coverage of the vaccination campaign by the Data team of elDiario.es wasn’t limited only to following the numbers as public service role but we also published great explaining stories of how mortality was plummeting thanks to the inoculation and dozens of stories denouncing global inequality in the distribution of vaccines between rich and poor countries. In addition, we also published exclusives where we had to fight the Government for accessing data such as the first mortality map in Spain at the municipality level. Tracking the coronavirus crisis conditioned our daily workflow but it did not prevent us from being able to publish great in-depth investigations and visual reports. For example, our special project ""Spain lives in apartments"" that analyzes and maps the footprint of more than 12 million buildings in the country to explain why Spain is one of the countries that has built the highest and most dense cities compared to other metropolises of the world. Also the analyzes that we publish on the labor market that remained after the pandemic, where we reveal exclusive data obtained by transparency of the levels of temporary employment in Spain that suppose the creation and destruction of an average of 100,000 jobs every day or the gaps that exist in the unemployment rate depending on your gender, age, region or educational level. The team also prepared the coverage of the regional elections in Madrid and Catalonia, including the maps and live visualizations for election night and also publishing analysis stories or visual reports on the political exclusion gaps between rich and poor neighborhoods. Much of our work was dedicated to compensating for the lack of transparency and accessibility of data published by public administrations. In addition to correcting and compiling figures related to Covid-19, the team extracted from thousands of PDF pages the list of assets registered by the Church with irregular processes in Spain to publish the database to the public and facilitate claims. Apart from the Covid-19 data and the other investigations, we also monitored the summer heat waves and published a tracker of how the temperatures of all the Spanish capitals evolve day by day, in a bet to create content of personal interest for readers and also as an early warning.  ","English, Spanish",https://especiales.eldiario.es/spain-lives-in-flats/,https://www.eldiario.es/datos/desigualdad-desempleo-consulta-tasa-paro-brecha-demografia-juvenil-genero-sur_1_8428008.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/vacunas-edades-desplomando-casos-hospitalizaciones-covid_1_7980936.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/vacuna-covid-mapas-graficos-proceso-vacunacion-espana-mundo-enero-3_1_6782953.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/iglesia-puso-nombre-patrimonio-15-000-pisos-fincas-aparcamientos-espana-gracias-ley-aznar_1_7249317.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/espana-temporal-maquina-crea-destruye-100-000-empleos-dia_1_8527925.html,https://www.eldiario.es/datos/provincias-calentamiento-global-verano-calido-2015-2020_1_8174524.html,https://www.eldiario.es/datos/primer-mapa-mortalidad-covid-municipio-muestra-desigual-impacto-pandemia_1_7274498.html,https://www.eldiario.es/madrid/resultados-elecciones-4m-madrid-municipios-distritos_1_7897633.html,https://www.eldiario.es/internacional/radiografia-fabricacion-vacunas-35-paises-concentran-produccion-principales-dosis-coronavirus_1_8006149.html,,,,,,,

The jury cited ProPublica's creative use of government pollution data to show toxic ""hot spots"" around the country where people may be exposed to levels of excess cancer risk that would otherwise exceed allowable standards. The jury also commended ProPublica for its continued commitment to collaboration with local news organizations, bringing resources that local newsrooms otherwise wouldn't have access to.",ProPublica and Partner Newsrooms,"With a team of more than 100 journalists, ProPublica investigates a range of topics including government and politics, business, criminal justice, the environment, education, health care, immigration and technology. We focus on stories with the potential to spur real-world impact. Among other positive changes, our reporting has contributed to the passage of new laws; reversals of harmful policies and practices; and accountability for leaders at local, state and national levels. One thing core to the work we do is the belief that data journalism is a key way in which we can hold power to account and shine a light into dark places. In 2021, we published -- frequently working with partner newsrooms around the country -- a range of stories and interactive pieces that do just that.","The projects we’re included were some of the biggest we produced this year:   We showed how 250,000 people living in hot spots of industrial air pollution may be exposed to levels of excess cancer risk that the EPA otherwise deems unacceptable -- and lets readers see the dangers near them.   We used the greatest trove of heretofore secret financial information on the ultrawealthy in the U.S. ever made public to reveal how they pay tiny amounts of federal income taxes   We used EPA air sensors to monitor pollution in a south Florida community blanketed with ash from sugar cane harvesting   We used genomic sequencing data to track an ongoing salmonella outbreak and created a mobile tool that let shoppers look up salmonella rates for the plant that processed the chicken at their supermarket.   We built an interactive video presentation that let readers watch the events of January 6 unfold as though they were present at the insurrection. This project, which published hundreds of videos for the first time, was cited as evidence in impeachment of former President Donald Trump, and in dozens of court documents charging participants with crimes.   We also published urgent, data-driven projects about the police department in New York City, one of the largest in the Country, on police union contracts in New Jersey, and on home-improvement lending.

United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,Shortlist,,Sondre Ulvund Solstad,"My career in journalism began roughly the same time as this pandemic did. “Boring” is a word that may spring to mind for many people when I try to explain what I’ve been doing since: If you are interested in calculating confidence intervals, methodologies, the importance of saying “I am really unsure”, and the difference between knowing what to expect for a group and what to expect for a person of that group, you are probably an outlier. But even if you are not, please read on anyway. What I’ve spent much of my time doing - statistical modelling - may not be worthy of a thriller in terms of the action it entails: mostly thinking, sometimes codin. But the journalism it has enabled me to create is, at least to me, as important and exciting as anything.
Short bio: I joined The Economist in February of 2020. Before that I was at Princeton University (PhD research, completed in December of 2020), and before that I did a BA at NYU.","I am the author of all the linked projects. That means I did the writing, research, and modelling. Visuals (include interactives), were created - in my view masterfully - by our designers and visual data journalists based on the data I provided.  
This submission has links from two big projects, both about the pandemic, and two small.
The first is a covid-19 risk estimator, with an associated article and methodology. The estimator is an online tool that enables people to fill in pre-existing conditions (e.g. asthma, diabetes and hyperlipidemia) and get the risk of hospitalization and death by age and gender should they be diagnosed with covid-19. Anytime someone uses the tool, a machine learning model running in the cloud is used to generate a prediction. This tool, and the data used to construct it, was also the basis of an investigation into covid-19 illness. 
The estimator has been used by academic researchers at Brown, Harvard, New York and other universities, as well as the American Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Researchers at NYU Langone are currently, together with me, exploring how to use the tool to optimize allocation of booster doses of vaccine. These researchers turned to us, because, as far they knew, no better tool was available. 
The second is my estimate of covid-19’s true death toll for every country and territory. This includes an article, a methodology, an online interactive (that updates daily), and an article centered on South Asia (with reporting). This project aimed to estimate and show a more accurate representation of the pandemic’s true death toll. The effort has been widely praised by international organizations, receiving a thank-you from the WHO, who called it ‘heroic’, a letter from the UN praising it as “exemplary”, and used as the basis for analysis by the World Bank, as well as acknowledgement from the Global Fund, one of the largest distributors of pandemic aid. Researchers at the University of Oxford call it: “the most comprehensive and rigorous attempt to understand how mortality has changed during the pandemic at the global level.” 
The project’s estimates have also been widely used, and even become part of the covid-19 “data” tracked by Our World In Data. I also know that at least one of the world’s largest aid organizations have used them in discussions of how to allocate pandemic aid. They are also being used by the World Health Organization. Upon request, I’m also regularly advising the WHO on related questions, joining their working group on the topic. I think it has been important to show the death toll in developing countries: using official numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, both dependent on testing, means underestimating the severity of the pandemic in precisely the places with the least resources to fight it. This enables people to do better.
This project has a link to a github repository as well: both projects are 100% open source. 
Finally, there are two smaller projects to show breadth. The first, “the beef with beef”, looks at climate change, and how by cooking so many cows, humans are cooking themselves, too. The second, “coming clean”, looks at how Twitter’s algorithm favors politicians on the right, and unreliable media. That analysis expanded on an academic paper by Twitter’s own researchers, who in turn had used a method I pioneered as a journalist in 2020.",English,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/03/13/our-covid-19-model-estimates-odds-of-hospitalisation-and-death,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/covid-pandemic-mortality-risk-estimator,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/03/11/how-we-built-our-covid-19-risk-estimator,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/05/15/there-have-been-7m-13m-excess-deaths-worldwide-during-the-pandemic,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-estimates,https://www.economist.com/asia/what-the-delta-variant-did-to-south-east-asia/21804360,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/05/13/how-we-estimated-the-true-death-toll-of-the-pandemic,https://github.com/TheEconomist/covid-19-the-economist-global-excess-deaths-model,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/10/02/treating-beef-like-coal-would-make-a-big-dent-in-greenhouse-gas-emissions,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/11/13/according-to-twitter-twitters-algorithm-favours-conservatives,,,,,,,
Singapore,Kontinentalist,Small,Shortlist,,Kontinentalist,"Kontinentalist was founded in four years ago with the mission of changing the world's conversations about Asia. But the way to do so wasn't always clear. Initially, we'd considered and experimented with various ideas—for example, being a massive repository for Asian data. It was only more recently that we've clarified our abilities and method: we strive to elevate the conversation about Asia, and to do so through data-driven stories, bridging the gap between research and the public. 

Firstly, we do this by partnering with organisations like think tanks, humanitarian organisations, conservation and activist collectives, who provide expertise and valuable lived experiences to make the stories real and grounded in expertise. Basically, we try to unlock the potential for insight by working with these organisations whose data might otherwise go untapped. We then lend our data visualisation and narrative skills to the issues, investigating and presenting it in a fresh and engaging way that's rarely seen in this part of the world. 

Secondly, as we're aware we and others in the region operate in a media environment that's sometimes challenging— e.g., our regional voices are under-represented in global media institutions, data access and literacy is low, other challenging sociopolitical contexts—we run many initiatives that strive to address these challenges. For example, we speak with and profile Asian data practitioners to raise their profile, and we contribute what we can to public education via talks and data literacy series and workshops. In this way, we go far beyond the remit of a traditional newsroom. To truly enhance the power of data journalism, we not only make worthy data stories, but also strive to build a wider community to be more receptive and to be more active producers of these stories. 

Thirdly, in terms of inspiration and mentors, the data visualisation and journalism community has so many wonderful people to learn from, it's hard to single out any. We've definitely benefited from just absorbing the incredible data journalism work that exists out there, and it's probably shaped the work we can do on a subconscious level and by expanding our imagination of what's possible. Overall, however, there isn't any other organisation of similar size and regional context that does exactly what we do in terms of our mission and the various initiatives we run. 

In all, I believe Kontinentalist should be considered for special recognition because: (1) We're truly pushing the envelope for innovative data journalism, both in the content itself but also in how we work—bringing entirely new communities into this field and helping them realise the potential of their data too, which also benefits our communities. (2) Despite being much smaller, we're doing more than producing data stories, as we try to nurture the field and community. (3) We're quite unique in the combination of all that we do and why we do what we do, and we hope it inspires people all over the world to chart their own path too.","Kontinentalist is a node for many collaborative data stories in Asia. We work with all kinds of organisations, from think tanks and international humanitarian organisations to smaller grassroots activists and citizens. This means most of our stories include collaborators but generally the workflow is such that Kontinentalist does the bulk of the work for every project: the collaborator might share some data or insights; we'd supplement with our research, query and clean the data, storyboard, design, draft, develop, and iterate. 

In terms of challenges, there's the familiar one of lack of easy data access and more generally a culture of journalistic freedom and awareness where we operate. As we're not a full-time newsroom, we also don't have capacity to exclusively produce data stories as much as we're passionate about doing so. Other challenges tend to be more specific to each individual project, for example, cleaning unstructured data or coordinating multiple actors. 

How we overcome these challenges: We prioritise the topics that we feel would have the greatest societal impact, by filling in an information gap or covering an angle that hasn't been done before in the existing conversation. We also get very creative in terms of what counts as data sources and persistent in searching for leads. We are disciplined in making sure data is actually central to the topic, making sure to marry the story with the form rather than just having ornamental visualisations. Thus in the portfolio projects you see, they're of topics that are pressing and we felt weren't sufficiently covered by regional journalism, we had good data sources and key collaborators to provide valuable insight, and the data was central to the narrative and would help illuminate the public on important matters.

As for other operational issues like capacity and coordination issues, we try to restructure where sensible or move things around. At all times, however, we abide by our values and commitment to ethical knowledge production: 

Innovative yet rigorous storytelling
We believe story dictates form, not the other way round
We strive to move beyond today’s digital storytelling techniques
We prefer slow thinking to chasing news cycles 
We research and fact-check everything
We’re transparent about where we get our data and how we handle it
We change our minds when new or better evidence emerges

A principled approach
We’re all about cultural context, because facts don’t live in a vacuum
We refuse to exoticise Asia, and resist Eurocentrism in all its forms
We treat myths, legends, and local knowledge with respect
We stand for freedom of speech
We care about our environment and saving it for future generations

Unique and unheard voices 
We support diversity in identity and worldview
We believe that each individual brings something unique to the table
We tailor our work to give meaningful voices a platform
We thrive on collaborations and feedback
We only work with partners who value openness, constructive criticism, and working together on challenging issues",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/sexual-assault-and-abuse-in-singapore-need-more-than-the-law,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/otters-are-cute-but-endangered-and-trafficked-as-pets-in-asia,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/the-rise-of-tech-women-in-asia,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/a-cultural-history-of-han-chinese-names-for-girls-and-boys-in-china,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/who-trees-dont-shield-from-the-urban-heat-island-effect,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/hepatitis-c-kills-as-asia-struggles-to-get-treatment,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/how-do-boomers-millennials-and-gen-z-feel-global-warming-differently,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/is-foreign-investment-sustainable-for-cambodia,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/clothes-swapping-and-upcycling-in-singapores-eco-friendly-fashion,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/hepatitis-c-kills-as-asia-struggles-to-get-treatment,,,,,,,
Spain,La vanguardia,Big,Shortlist,,Laura Aragó,"It’s challenging, demanding and frustrating (sometimes). I felt data journalism was a bit like this 8 years ago when I made my first steps as a recent graduate student and I still feel quite the same about it. And somehow it’s part of the magic: each article is an opportunity to explore new techniques for turning data into stories. The precision offered by the data, stills seems to me the best way to explain the changes in our society. And most important, to report what consequences it has on citizens. 
I have dedicated almost my entire short professional career to data journalism. Most of it working as a full-time employee at La Vanguardia, a Spanish newspaper based in Barcelona. Founded in 1881 it is considered one of the oldest newspapers in the Iberian Peninsula and currently has about 200 hundred journalists on staff. Despite its long journey in paper format, it has a short history -almost 2 years- as a first digital newsroom.
As the only member of the data unit in the newspaper the last six years have been an endless roller coaster: I have learned how to be a better journalist, how to code (or at least try it) to offer some kind of interactivity to articles, how to get the most out of data analysis, and how to convince managers that it was necessary to invest more resources in data journalism. 
During these years a network of excellent professionals around the world, always willing to help, and a constant flow of wonderful examples of data journalism have been an engine to continue learning. Whenever possible, I have tried to turn numbers into human stories that help potential readers to better understand what a bunch of numbers mean. And I have found in cartography a powerful tool to locate these stories about the territory.","In almost all articles I’ve used public data from institutions; R and QGis to download, process, clean and analyze data; html and javascript to make the data visualizations. Described below:
Demographic imbalance: The most populated square kilometer in Europe. Demographers say that talent always emerges in the most populated places. If the concentration of population is synonymous with creativity, then the neighborhood of Florida, in L'Hospitalet, and that of Clignancourt, north of Paris, are its greatest exponents. Florida and Clignancourt, the two most populated places in Europe, live parallel realities a thousand kilometers apart: more than 50,000 inhabitants in just one square kilometer, a community of neighbors that perfectly embodies the melting pot of cultures that coexist in Europe and the same soundtrack, the drill. Tools: R, javascript, mapbox and datawrapper
Public transport vs private: The car continues to be the most effective means of transport in the large Spanish cities. Thousands of citizens choose, every day, to leave aside public transport and move around in a private vehicle. And it's not surprising: economic reasons aside, in the big Spanish cities you can get almost ten times farther by car in 15 minutes than by public transport. Urban areas are stuck between an insufficient public transport network and a network of roads clogged with cars. In a context of climate crisis and energy emergency, the commitment to public transport is running late and the time to build a network at the level of the great European capitals is running out.

Smothered renters: one in four have trouble paying rent. There is a broad consensus that establishes that a family should not spend more than 30% of their income on rent in order to cover the rest of the expenses with a minimum of comfort. When this figure exceeds 40%, families enter a situation of risk and high residential stress. In large cities, such as Madrid and Barcelona, ​​a quarter of the population lives in areas where rent eats up, on average, more than 30% of household income. Tools: r, mapbox, scrollama, javascript.

The Generation gap. Stopper generation: the broken axis of the social elevator. There are two generations - the X and the millennials- who have difficulties developing their lives due to the existence of a previous generation that acts as a buffer: they concentrate decision-making positions in companies, administration , universities, unions and the cultural world and, as a consequence, slow down the professional promotion of later generations and artistic, intellectual and political renewal.
Campaign against Covid: The WHO global vaccination target will not be met until 2030. To reach 70% in the summer of 2022, the current rate of vaccination should be multiplied by nine. Tools: excel, rstudio, datawrapper. Conducted with Carles Villalonga (writing and analyzing) and me (analyzing and data visualizations).
2021 closes with twice as many deaths from Covid than in 2020. At least 3.5 million people have died from covid throughout 2021. It is the balance left by this second year of the pandemic and doubles the figure for 2020, which was around 1.8 million deaths. Tools: r, svelte, javascript, datawrapper

Germany,Zeit Online,Big,Shortlist,,Zeit Online,"Which mask should I wear? Have I contracted the coronavirus? Where are the infection numbers highest? In the year when the whole world was looking at something you can't see, visualization is everything. 

When the number of cases rises rapidly in the spring, it quickly becomes clear that it's not just the absolute number of cases that's important. It is the development that is crucial - and at the same time difficult to understand. Exponential growth, doubling times, the reproduction number R: How can we present all this as simply as possible for our readers? 

The knowledge department immediately joined forces with the interactive and data departments and has been working closely together ever since. Not only are the known Sars-Cov-2 infections researched directly in the counties, but also complex scientific relationships are visualized as simply as possible. With graphics, maps, animations, interactive calculators or illustrations, the team tries to prepare all information in a way that is understandable for their readers.","With the onset of the pandemic, our focus shifted - suddenly all editors, programmers, data journalists and designers were working on one topic and on how to best shape the coverage of a global emergency. Science journalism and the visualization of it faced a new challenge that had to be tackled together. ZEIT ONLINE pooled all its capacities for this purpose and accompanied the developments of the pandemic for a year in graphics, maps and illustrations. 

The evaluation of complex data sets, their processing, presentation and explanation are among the important tasks in the global exceptional situation. Science and data journalists, as well as visualization experts, have a crucial role to play here, because they communicate the knowledge of researchers to society. They provide orientation in a situation that is unprecedented - and changes almost daily. ZEIT ONLINE's Corona reporting is an example of exactly what this can look like: always up-to-date, always comprehensible, always close to what moves a society, always in the best possible form of presentation.

Brazil,Nexo Jornal,Small,Shortlist,,Nexo Jornal,"Nexo Jornal is a Brazilian newspaper, centered in context journalism. It was founded in 2015 and since then has received attention for the quality of its production and, specially, for its data visualizations.
 
Graphics are essential for Nexo's coverage: we try to use data visualization for everything, from covid-19 and economics, to music and sports. 
 
Our entire work is collective but our team is also divided in two sub-groups: one dedicated to design, and another to data science. Recently, we had a new addition of a web developer. In total, we are 7 people.
 
We are a very young team (mean age of 25 years old) but really committed to improve our work every day.","This year our team, as every other newsroom in the planet, strived to maintain the delicate balance of reporting on the covid-19 pandemic with the care and attention the matter requires, while not neglecting other emerging crises, and also, as we call internally, lighter subjects, such as pop culture, music and sports. The selection below aims do showcase just that.

We managed our efforts and successfully covered large events like the Olympics and COP 26, while maintaining two daily charts with national and global covid figures in our newsletter.

Our portfolio is a selection of some of our best weekly work. Every Monday the whole team gets together to brainstorm ideas and decide on the week's tasks. These meetings are fueled by discussions of themes such as politics, current events, science and culture
.
Most of our stories start as a team member putting up a dataset or report for discussion. We then weigh how relevant or interesting the data presented are against how robust is its methodology and how feasible it is to work with. 

Once we approve an idea, usually a data scientist starts delving into the data and writing up the text and general structure of the piece. They then pass the text and raw charts on to an information designer that realizes the story on the page, deciding the layout and visual identity of the piece. 

The first version is then shared with the rest of the team, who comment and double-check the charts, figures and text before passing the revised version to our editor (who is also one of our data scientists).

The tools used by our data scientists to analyze and plot data are mainly R, via RStudio with special focus on the [tidyverse] packages. Google Sheets and Flourish are used for more straightforward and time sensitive work. 

The information designers, in turn, work mostly with Adobe Illustrator to create illustrations and highlight the most important aspect of the visualizations. They also make data visualizations in Flourish when needed.

Romania,"Panorama.ro, Are.news",Small,Shortlist,,Edit Gyenge,"I’ve been working with data all my life, starting with my first job as a journalist 16 years ago, during the period I worked as a consultant, and until this day when I managed to transform my passion for data into a business. It never felt more important and fulfilling than it is right now. 
As a TV journalist, I learned the rigors of news broadcasting. Classic, but strong rules that were taught by experts who had been trained in international TV stations. Rigour, correctness, and a hint of creativity, just enough to color inside the lines when it comes to daily news broadcasting.  The downside of television is that you need footage to complete a story. A simple spreadsheet isn’t enough, neither are words. When working, years later, for a newspaper things were slightly different. Didn’t need the footage, but still needed pieces to tight up the story. 
It seemed like the data always needed a second or third party element to complement it, to make it visible. I first discovered professional data visualization 5 years ago, even though I have been playing with charts and graphs all my life, and fell in love ever since. My job never felt more important and with such a huge sense of accomplishment like it is today. When visualizing data, the only second or third element is your own creativity, vision, and knowledge. Of course, there are rules, things that make the difference between amazing data visualization and a bad representation. There is also a huge responsibility not to lie with charts and not to be biased by the data itself, but the outcome can lead to so much more than a simple journalistic story. Data visualization is a tool for communities,  it’s a map of understanding the world in a data polluted environment. It’s a dictionary for building future knowledge by translating present facts. It means educating and offering insight.
It’s been 4 years since I’ve been building visual representations of data for national and international media outlets, NGO’s and companies and with each year I come to accept the fact that even though there are amazing people out there sharing their knowledge and offering guidance, even though I bought each and every single book ever written by data visualization gurus, it still is a solitary experience. With every new chart or infographic, I feel that there is so much to improve and so much to talk about, so many possible correlations. There is a lot of personal work and self-improvement in this field that seems to be aging, but it never gets old. Even with simple forms of representation like line charts and bar charts there still are lessons to be learned and things to improve. It’s a journey of continuously trying to make the data visible, visual, and valuable.
Making a difference never felt so achievable and at the same time so challenging. I firmly believe that achievements in this field are little pieces from which others can benefit from and that is a mission that I try to accomplish with every data visualization.","Link 1

1. The effect of the fear of death due to Covid on the intention to vaccinate (low excess mortality determines a low vaccination rate)
2. Conspiracy theories (where do Romanians stand when it comes to conspiracy theories?)
3. Level of education and understanding (are Romanians educated enough or self-sufficient?)
4. Distrust in authorities and the health system (do Romanians trust doctors?)
5. The contribution of extremist parties to the anti-vaccine discourse (is it possible that extremist parties' discourse contributed to a general mistrust in vaccines?)

United States,NASA Earth Observatory,Small,Shortlist,,NASA Earth Observatory,"The Earth-observing satellites that orbit our planet generate dozens of terabytes of data each year. While much of this data is downloadable and freely available to the public, interpreting it can be extremely challenging. Only some researchers, data visualizers, and data journalists have the expertise and bandwidth to do it well.

The NASA Earth Observatory is charged with making such data and observations accessible to the public. Founded in 1999 as an educational outreach project, the website has grown to become NASA's flagship for breaking Earth science news, imagery, and data visualization. Over our 22-year history, we have published more than 11,000 stories and generated hundreds of millions of pageviews on our website alone. News organizations and scientific institutions regularly expand our reach by reusing and amplifying our stories.   

We continually gather and evaluate new observations collected by satellites and Earth scientists and put data at the heart of a new story every day. Though we work within a science institution, we have been given great autonomy and responsibility to apply journalistic principles to our storytelling, and that has helped us build trust with our readers. With tens of thousands of daily visits to our website and millions of followers on social media (10.7 million on Facebook, 2.5 million on Twitter, and 1.5 million on Instagram), our visuals and stories routinely influence the national and international conversation about key environmental issues. 

Over the decades, astronauts have looked back at Earth and noted that international borders are not visible from space. We try to live that. Though our team is based in the United States, our content and outlook has a strong international component. We routinely share images and stories from around the world that are overlooked by mainstream media outlets in the U.S. Our readers notice and appreciate that: About half of them reach our website from abroad. Only one-tenth of our social media followers are based in the U.S. 

Whether the topic is rising global temperatures, Amazon deforestation, or the impacts of hurricanes, wildfires, or illegal fishing, our team strives to offer a big-picture perspective. In some cases – such as tracking fire activity or deforestation in remote or less developed areas – satellites are the only feasible way to track changes over time and across borders. Our imagery and analysis fills an important niche in the information ecosystem.  

Our team is small – two data visualizers, four science writer-editors, a data archivist, and a web developer – but we have more than 110 collective years of experience that help us bring depth, rigor, and science literacy to these stories. We have academic and professional experience in cartography, library sciences, computer science, graphic design, remote sensing, science journalism, and Earth sciences. Every story we produce requires visualizers, editors, and writers to work closely with each other and with subject matter experts to ensure that stories are scientifically sound, appropriately contextualized, and readable. Text and visuals must fit together and advance the same concepts. If they don't, we spike that story. 

We are probably an unusual entrant in this competition, but we believe we occupy a special place in science communication. At a time when our planet is stressed, we provide unique insights into how it is changing and why. But lest we be too dour and serious, we also remember – and regularly remind readers – that data is beautiful, and so is our planet.","While Earth Observatory covers all Earth sciences and many types of natural events, we have selected a series of stories from 2021 that highlight the human fingerprint on environmental changes and challenges. 

Chief among these is global warming and climate change. NASA scientists are the keepers of one of the most widely cited analyses of global temperature trends in the world, and our team plays a critical role in producing visuals about global warming and its effects on sea ice. As we reported in ""2020 Tied for Lowest Year on Record"" and ""Sea Ice Highs and Lows,"" the bad news about these indicators continued in 2021.  

After fires and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in 2019 inspired intensive and sometimes misleading media coverage, our team began publishing a series of stories about the history and nuance of deforestation trends in the region. Our story from February 2021 (Fires Raged in the Amazon Again in 2020) details something that most outlets overlooked: the 2020 fire year was worse than 2019, even if fewer people were tweeting about it. The visualizations in this story were designed specifically to address some misconceptions that had surfaced in public conversation about the Amazon. 

Others stories in the portfolio created buzz for less predictable reasons. In February 2021, we published a story highlighting a striking photo of gold mining in Peru (Gold Rush in the Peruvian Amazon) that led to articles in CNN, BBC, and several other outlets about Peru's ""rivers of gold."" Later that year, we followed up with a more substantive story (Finding Gold Mining Hotspots in Peru) that detailed how teams of researchers have developed a satellite-based tool to identify illegal gold mining hotspots. 

Other stories – using satellite observations of nighttime lights to identify illegal fishing (Arabian Night Lights), investigating the causes of megafires in California (What’s Behind California’s Surge of Large Fires?), or tracking garbage in the ocean (Mapping Marine Microplastics) – did not break records for pageviews or media mentions, but perhaps they should have. In each case, the stories used remote sensing data to highlight environmental problems that would be a challenge to conceptualize in the absence of a satellite perspective.",English,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147946/fires-raged-in-the-amazon-again-in-2020,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147973/a-deadly-debris-flow-in-india,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/149017/hunting-milky-seas-by-satellite,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/148307/arabian-night-lights,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/148908/whats-behind-californias-surge-of-large-fires,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/149163/mapping-marine-microplastics,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147794/2020-tied-for-warmest-year-on-record,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/148767/hurricane-ida-batters-louisiana,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/148194/sea-ice-highs-and-lows,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/148439/finding-gold-mining-hotspots-in-peru,,,,,,,
Australia,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC),Big,Shortlist,,"Digital Story Innovations team, ABC News","The ABC’s Digital Story Innovations team is a collection of journalists, developers, a designer and social media and video specialists. The team is focussed on data-driven, visual storytelling for Australian audiences.
 
Since its inception in 2017, we’ve used data to investigate and visualise stories on a broad range of issues from political donations to illegal logging, to tracking Australia’s vaccine rollout and telling the story of how Australia’s battle with the disease unfolded in its first year.
 
The DSI team’s 2021 portfolio showcases how data-driven techniques can be used across the full spectrum of story creation -- from discovery to research, analysis and presentation -- to either break new terrain or deepen public understanding of familiar topics.

The portfolio demonstrates how innovative storytelling techniques - such as data-driven investigation, graphics and interactive design - can be seamlessly blended with traditional person-centred storytelling to powerful effect. 

It includes ground-breaking investigations based on public data (vaccine tracker), exclusive access to tightly-held datasets (political donations), in-depth analyses of spatial datasets (Lawless loggers) as well as innovative use of publicly available datasets (coronavirus and vaccine stories).
 
Each project demonstrates a commitment to rigorous, meaningful and transparent use of data while being unique in concept and execution.","Our series ""Hitting the Jackpot"" is the most comprehensive and detailed examination to date of the money flowing from Australia’s gambling industry into the political system.
Our project adopted a new approach to this problem, expanding on previous analyses to trace political payments from more than 370 gambling-related businesses and individuals over 22 years.

As part of our story about logging, we obtained high-resolution LiDAR digital elevation data which allowed us to investigate claims the state-run timber company VicForests was conducting widespread and systemic illegal logging in vital water catchments. Using the data, the team was able to show large areas of forest had been logged in breach of the law. 

""Anatomy of our battle against COVID-19"" was published on the anniversary of Australia’s first documented cases of COVID-19, uses the ABC’s national dataset of every confirmed coronavirus case to tell the story of how Australia’s battle with the disease unfolded in its first year.

""Untangling Australia’s vaccine rollout targets"" traced every twist and turn in the short, confusing history of the rollout program’s first three months. To compile the timeline of targets, we combed through government media releases, press conferences videos, news stories and broadcast interviews, transcripts of questions and statements to parliament and rollout planning documents. 

We paired this with data on actual vaccinations (collated by our team from multiple sources as national data was not available until five months into the rollout) to show how far the government had fallen short of its (many) promises.

""Tracking Australia’s COVID vaccine rollout"" is a real-time database that visualises the state of play in Australia’s much-criticised vaccine rollout which began in early 2021. It has been expanded and updated as new data has come to hand.

""How quickly is COVID spreading in your neighbourhood?"" used an automatic data feed to provide a hyperlocal perspective of the the rapid spread of Delta infections. At the time, the state government was scrambling to contain the outbreak by using tough lockdowns. These were imposed neighbourhood by neighbourhood, based on how quickly infections were spreading. 

This story allowed residents to access and understand the data that was driving the government’s daily decisions and public health directives. The story text was updated every few days to highlight the latest trends in the numbers.

The article ""Tracing the path of destruction in India’s Himalayas"" used open-source investigative techniques to piece together what had happened in the aftermath of the landslide. We geolocated videos from social media and matched that up with the damage that could be seen from satellite data we had sourced from the commercial satellite operator Planet Labs.

In our story about the Chinese plan to dam a Himalayan river, we used Webgl technology to create a 3D model of the terrain to convey just how treacherous and complex construction of this dam would be.

Other projects in the portfolio that are similar in style include mapping New Zealand’s Alpine Fault line and customising a 3D sequence of earthquake modelling scenarios.",English,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-14/how-the-gambling-industry-cashed-in-on-political-donations/100509026,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-23/how-gambling-industrys-biggest-political-donors-influence-votes/100592068,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-01-25/covid-19-spread-through-australia-over-year/13078574,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-02/charting-australias-covid-vaccine-rollout/13197518,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-28/untangling-australia-s-covid-vaccine-rollout-timetable/100156720,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-25/how-quickly-is-covid-spreading-in-your-nsw-postcode/100402830,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-24/hi-res-elevation-data-pinpoints-outlaw-logging-in-forests/100626640,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-25/chinas-plan-to-build-mega-dam-on-yarlung-tsangpo-brahmaputra/100146344,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-02-11/satellites-capture-scale-of-indian-glacier-collapse/13137924,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-22/nz-racing-to-be-ready-for-magnitude-8-on-alpine-fault/100134024,,,,,,,
Spain,Maldita.es,Small,Shortlist,,Maldito Dato (Maldita.es),"Maldito Dato is the section of Maldita.es specialized in data journalism and FOIA.

It is a benchmark in Spain in terms of the use of the right of access, transparency and open data.

During the pandemic, it has done a great job via FOIA to obtain a multitude of databases and information unknown to the public. Thanks to all this information and the subsequent work of data journalism, he has been able to tell a great multitude of relevant information.

Maldito Dato has already been recognized in Spain with the GO! Award of FOIA and Transparency in the media category (both in 2020 and 2021) and with the Open Data award from the Junta de Castilla y León in the data journalism category (2021), among other recognitions for his related work in this field. In fact, the fundamental basis of Maldito Dato is clear: data journalism and right of access. They are the two main tools that Maldito Dato tries to use to tell stories and do good journalism. And in 2021, obviously, we have tried to use it especially to focus on the pandemic.","During 2021 Maldito Dato has published an investigation on Spanish hospitals in the pandemic and has revealed the capacity and daily occupation of all of them.

We has also revealed via FOIA who has attended the meetings between the regional governments and the Government of Spain during the pandemic. This information has been hidden throughout the pandemic despite the demands of civil society. Maldito Dato obtained it via FOIA and was able to create and analyze a dataset to see that governments such as Catalonia or Melilla were missing on many occasions.

Via requests we have also been able to reveal during this year that almost 400 workers from the Murcian health department jumped the vaccination line, how in February 2020, before measures were taken in Spain, emergency calls were already triggered due to the coronavirus or the data on infections and deaths among health workers that the Government did not publish.

We were also able to tell the story of retired doctors and health workers who had not finished their degree who were being hired or the vaccination of the regional Health Councillors.

They are just some examples. But Maldito Dato has been clear about the importance of fighting via FOIA for information of public interest that citizens had the right to know during a time as serious and relevant as the pandemic.",Spanish,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20211104/investigacion-hospitales-pandemia-ocupacion-coronavirus/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20211231/10-informaciones-periodisticas-maldito-dato-transparencia-2021/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20211229/Gobierno-Murcia-vacuna-377-trabajadores-no-asistenciales/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20211202/asistentes-consejo-interterritorial-autonomias-covid/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20210518/llamadas-sanitarias-112-summa-comunidad-madrid-estado-alarma/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20210421/sanitarios-hospitalizados-fallecidos-pandemia/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20210514/inicio-pandemia-comunidades-contratacion-extraordinaria-profesionales-sanitarios-estudiantes-jubilados/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20211020/vacunacion-consejeros-sanidad-coronavirus/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20210204/consejo-interterritorial-sanidad-comunidades-coronavirus-actas/,https://maldita.es/tag/transparencia,,,,,,,
